# Vid_summarizer
The proposed project, Vid Summarizer, aims to develop an AI-powered application that automates the summarization of YouTube videos. This application leverages Whisper AI for speech-totext transcription, ensuring accurate extraction of spoken content from videos. Once transcribed,
the application employs the BART transformer model to generate concise and meaningful summaries, providing users with a quick overview of the video’s key points.
Beyond summarization, Vid Summarizer enhances the learning experience by integrating Google’s
Generative AI (Gemini) for quiz generation. By analyzing the transcribed content, the application
generates interactive quizzes that help users retain information more effectively. The quiz format is customizable, allowing users to choose between multiple-choice questions, fill-in-the-blanks,
or other assessment styles.
Furthermore, the application compiles both the summarized content and quizzes into a downloadable PDF, ensuring offline accessibility. This feature allows users to review key concepts anytime, making the tool particularly useful for students, researchers, and professionals who need
structured learning materials.
A user-friendly web interface facilitates seamless interaction, enabling users to simply input a
YouTube URL and receive structured educational content within seconds. By eliminating the need
for manual summarization and quiz creation, Vid Summarizer empowers learners to optimize their
study process, improve retention of key concepts, and enhance productivity.
With applications spanning across educational institutions, corporate training, and self-paced
learning, Vid Summarizer is a valuable tool for anyone looking to make the most out of digital video
content. By bridging the gap between long-form videos and efficient learning, this application
ensures that knowledge acquisition remains accessible, time-efficient, and engaging for a diverse
range of users.
